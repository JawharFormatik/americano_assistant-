The second challenge is junior, oriented to children aged under 18, where they have a 4-wheel robot controlled with a remote control device, and the goal is to reach the finish line. The third challenge is the masterpiece, which is the All-terrain challenge, similar to junior but with older competitors and a bigger map.
